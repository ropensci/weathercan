This package is makes it easier to search for and download multiple months/years of historical weather data from [Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) website](http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html).

Bear in mind that these downloads can be fairly large and performing multiple downloads may use up ECCC's bandwidth unecessarily. Try to stick to what you need.

For more details and tutorials checkout the [weathercan website](http://steffilazerte.github.io/weathercan)

## Installation

Use the `devtools` package to directly install R packages from github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # If not already installed
devtools::install_github("steffilazerte/weathercan") 
```

To build the vignettes (tutorials) locally, use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("steffilazerte/weathercan", build_vignettes = TRUE) 
```

View the available vignettes with `vignette(package = "weathercan")`  

View a particular vignette with, for example, `vignette("weathercan", package = "weathercan")`

## General usage

To download data, you first need to know the `station_id` associated with the station you're interested in.

### Stations

`weathercan` includes a data frame called `stations` which includes a list of stations and their details (including `station_id`.

```{r}
head(stations)
glimpse(stations)
```

You can look through this data frame directly, or you can use the `stations_search` function:

```{r}
stations_search("Kamloops", interval = "hour")
```

Time frame must be one of "hour", "day", or "month".

You can also search by proximity:

```{r}
stations_search(coords = c(50.667492, -120.329049), dist = 20, interval = "hour")
```

### Weather

Once you have your `station_id`(s) you can download weather data:

```{r, R.options = list(tibble.max_extra_cols = 0)}
kam <- weather_dl(station_ids = 51423, start = "2016-01-01", end = "2016-02-15")
kam
```

You can also download data from multiple stations at once:

```{r, R.options = list(tibble.max_extra_cols = 0)}
kam_pg <- weather_dl(station_ids = c(48248, 51423), start = "2016-01-01", end = "2016-02-15")
kam_pg
```

And plot it:

```{r kam_plt, fig.height=6, fig.width=12}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = kam_pg, aes(x = time, y = temp, group = station_name, colour = station_name)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_line()
```

## Similar packages

1) [`rclimateca`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rclimateca/index.html)

`weathercan` and `rclimateca` were developed at roughly the same time and as a result, both present up-to-date methods for accessing and downloading data from ECCC. The largest differences between the two packages are: a) `weathercan` includes functions for interpolating weather data and directly integrating it into other data sources. b) `weathercan` actively seeks to apply tidy data principles in R and integrates well with the tidyverse including using tibbles and nested listcols. c) `rclimateca` contains arguments for specifying short vs. long data formats. d) `rclimateca` has the option of formatting data in the MUData format using the [`mudata2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mudata2/index.html) package by the same author.

2) [`CHCN`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/CHCN/index.html)

`CHCN` is an older package last updated in 2012. Unfortunately, ECCC updated their services within the last couple of years which caused a great many of the previous web scrapers to fail. `CHCN` relies on one of these (older web-scrapers)[https://classic.scraperwiki.com/scrapers/can-weather-stations/] and so is currently broken.
