\title{Search for stations by name or location}
\usage{
stations_search(name = NULL, coords = NULL, dist = 10,
  interval = c("hour", "day", "month"), stn = weathercan::stations,
  verbose = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character. A vector of length 1 or more with text against which
to match. Will match station names that contain all components of
\code{name}, but they can be in different orders and separated by other
text.}

\item{coords}{Numeric. A vector of length 2 with latitude and longitude of a
place to match against. Overrides \code{lat} and \code{lon} if also
provided.}

\item{dist}{Numeric. Match all stations within this many kilometers of the
\code{coords}.}

\item{interval}{Character. Return only stations with data at these intervals.
Must be any of "hour", "day", "month".}

\item{stn}{Data frame. The \code{stations} data frame to use. Will use the
one included in the package unless otherwise specified.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Include progress messages}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Suppress all messages (including messages regarding
missing data, etc.)}
}
\value{
Returns a subset of the stations data frame which match the search
  parameters. If the search was by location, an extra column 'distance' shows
  the distance in kilometres from the location to the station. If no stations
  are found withing `dist`, the closest 10 stations are returned.
}
\description{
Returns stations that match the name provided OR which are within \code{dist}
km of the location provided. This is designed to provide the user with
information with which to decide which station to then get weather data from.
}
\details{
To search by coordinates, users must make sure they have the
 \code{\link[sp]{sp}} package installed.
