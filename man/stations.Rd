\description{
A dataset containing station information downloaded from Environment and
Climate Change Canada. Note that a station may have several station IDs,
depending on how the data collection has changed over the years. Station
information can be updated by running \code{stations_new <-  stations_dl()}
and then by specifying stn = stations_new in most functions.
