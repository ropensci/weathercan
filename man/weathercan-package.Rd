\title{Easy downloading of weather data from Environment and Climate Change Canada}
\description{
\code{weathercan} is an R package for simplifying the downloading of
Historical Climate Data from the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)
\href{http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html}{website}
}
\details{
Bear in mind that these downloads can be fairly large and performing
multiple, downloads may use up Environment Canada's bandwidth unnecessarily.
Try to stick to what you need.

There are three main aspects of this package:

\enumerate{
  \item Access \strong{stations} lists
  \itemize{
    \item \code{\link{stations}} (a data frame listing stations)
    \item \code{\link{stations_search}()} identify stations by name or
    proximity to a location
    \item \code{\link{stations_all}()} re-download stations data
    }

\item Download \strong{weather} data
 \itemize{
   \item \code{\link{weather}()}
   }

\item Merge weather data into other data sets through interpolation over time
 \itemize{
   \item \code{\link{add_weather}()}
   }
}

We also include several practice data sets:

\itemize{
   \item \code{\link{finches}}
   \item \code{\link{kamloops}}
   \item \code{\link{kamloops_day}}
   \item \code{\link{pg}}
   }

As well as several vignettes:

\itemize{
   \item General Usage: \code{vignette("usage")}
   \item Merging and Interpolating: \code{vignette("interpolation")}
   \item Data Flags: \code{vignette("flags")}
   \item Data Glossary: \code{vignette("glossary")}
   }

\href{http://steffilazerte.github.io/weathercan}{Online} we also have an advanced article:

\itemize{
    \item Using \code{weathercan} with \href{http://tidyverse.org/}{tidyverse} (\href{http://steffilazerte.github.io/weathercan/articles/use_with_tidyverse.html}{here})
    }
