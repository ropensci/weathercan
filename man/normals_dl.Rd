)
}
\arguments{
\item{climate_ids}{Character. A vector containing the Climate ID(s) of the
station(s) you wish to download data from. See the \code{\link{stations}}
data frame or the \code{\link{stations_search}} function to find Climate
IDs.}

\item{normals_years}{Character. The year range for which you want climate
normals. Default \code{1981-2010}. One of \code{current},
\code{1981-2010}, or \code{1971-2000}. \code{current} returns only stations
from the most recent \emph{complete} normals year range (i.e. \code{1981-2010}).
Note: Some \code{1991-2020} are available online, but are not yet downloadable
via weathercan.}

\item{format}{Logical. If TRUE (default) formats measurements to numeric and
date accordingly. Unlike \code{weather_dl()}, \code{normals_dl()} will always format
column headings as normals data from ECCC cannot be directly made into a
data frame without doing so.}

\item{stn}{DEFUNCT. Now use \code{stations_dl()} to update internal data and
\code{stations_meta()} to check the date it was last updated.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Include progress messages}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Suppress all messages (including messages regarding
missing data, etc.)}

\description{
Downloads climate normals from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)
for one or more stations (defined by \code{climate_id}s). For details and units,
see the \code{\link{glossary_normals}} data frame or the \code{glossary_normals} vignette:
\code{vignette("glossary_normals", package = "weathercan")}
}
\details{
Climate normals from ECCC include two types of data, averages by
month for a variety of measurements as well as data relating to the
frost-free period. Because these two data sources are quite different, we
return them as nested data so the user can extract them as they wish. See
examples for how to use the \code{unnest()} function from the
\href{https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/}{\code{tidyr}}
package to extract the two different datasets.

The data also returns a column called \code{meets_wmo} this reflects whether or
not the climate normals for this station met the WMO standards for
temperature and precipitation (i.e. both have code >= A). Each measurement
column has a corresponding \verb{_code} column which reflects the data quality
of that measurement (see the
\href{https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Normals/Canadian_Climate_Normals_1991_2020_Calculation_Information.pdf}{1991-2020},
\href{https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Normals/Canadian_Climate_Normals_1981_2010_Calculation_Information.pdf}{1981-2010}, or
\href{https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Normals/Canadian_Climate_Normals_1971_2000_Calculation_Information.pdf}{1971-2000}
for more details) ECCC calculation documents.

Climate normals are downloaded from the url stored in option
\code{weathercan.urls.normals}. To change this location use:
\code{options(weathercan.urls.normals = "your_new_url")}.
