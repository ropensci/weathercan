[`tidyhydat`](https://docs.ropensci.org/tidyhydat) is another R package for accessing
data from ECCC. In this case, `tidyhydat` gives access to the [National Water Data Archive
(HYDAT)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey/data-products-services/national-archive-hydat.html).

HYDAT contains lots of data including stream flow (historical and real-time), water levels,
station metrics and information on data types and codes.

Here we'll go through a brief example of how hydrology data from `tidyhydat`
can compliment weather data from `weathercan` (and vice versa).

## Setup

### Loading packages


``` r
library(weathercan)
library(tidyhydat)
```

```
## Error in library(tidyhydat): there is no package called 'tidyhydat'
```

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(glue)
```

### Prep HYDAT data

`tidyhydat` data needs to be downloaded and cached locally in order to be used
(Note, this can take a while!)


``` r
download_hydat()
```


## Exploring climate and hydrology

In the summer of 2020, my region (Brandon, Manitoba) experienced an incredibly
heavy rain fall event. Our downspout was ripped off the gutter and many people in the
area experienced flooding as rain poured into their basements.

Let's take a look at how this event was captured by weather and hydrometric stations
monitored by ECCC.

The event occurred in late June/early July, so let's give ourselves a two-month
range.


``` r
dates <- c("2020-06-01", "2020-08-01")
```

We'll find a local Brandon weather station that has daily data for this range

``` r
stations_search("brandon", interval = "day",
                starts_latest = 2020, ends_earliest = 2020)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 17
##   prov  station_name station_id climate_id WMO_id TC_id   lat    lon  elev tz        interval start   end normals
##   <chr> <chr>             <dbl> <chr>       <dbl> <chr> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <chr>    <dbl> <dbl> <lgl>  
## 1 MB    BRANDON A         50821 5010481     71140 YBR    49.9 -100.0  409. Etc/GMT+6 day       2012  2025 FALSE  
## 2 MB    BRANDON RCS       49909 5010490     71136 PBO    49.9 -100.0  409. Etc/GMT+6 day       2012  2025 FALSE  
## # ℹ 3 more variables: normals_1991_2020 <lgl>, normals_1981_2010 <lgl>, normals_1971_2000 <lgl>
```

In this case "A" is for "Airport", let's go with that!


``` r
rain <- weather_dl(station_ids = 50821, interval = "day", start = dates[1], end = dates[2])
```

Take a quick look:


``` r
ggplot(data = rain, aes(x = date, y = total_rain)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Rain (mm)", expand = c(0,0))
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/tidyhydat-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7</p>
</div>

Yikes! You can see why my downspout came off!

Now let's get some HYDAT data to compare. First we'll find a local station


``` r
search_stn_name("brandon")
```

```
## Error in search_stn_name("brandon"): could not find function "search_stn_name"
```

There are a couple of options, but whoops, one's from Quebec! Let's filter this
to only Manitoba and only stations with 2020 data with the `hy_stn_data_range()`
function.


``` r
search_stn_name("brandon") %>%
  filter(PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC == "MB") %>%
  pull(STATION_NUMBER) %>%
  hy_stn_data_range() %>%
  filter(Year_from <= 2020, Year_to >= 2020)
```

```
## Error in hy_stn_data_range(.): could not find function "hy_stn_data_range"
```

Hmm, let's see what kind of data is available by looking at the included
`hy_data_types` data frame.


``` r
filter(hy_data_types, DATA_TYPE %in% c("H", "Q"))
```

```
## Error: object 'hy_data_types' not found
```

Great! We have both flow and water level data for a station number "05MH001",
"Assiniboine River at Brandon".


Let's grab the flow and water level data for this station.

``` r
flow <- hy_daily_flows(station_number = "05MH001",
                       start_date = dates[1], end_date = dates[2])
```

```
## Error in hy_daily_flows(station_number = "05MH001", start_date = dates[1], : could not find function "hy_daily_flows"
```

``` r
level <- hy_daily_levels(station_number = "05MH001",
                         start_date = dates[1], end_date = dates[2])
```

```
## Error in hy_daily_levels(station_number = "05MH001", start_date = dates[1], : could not find function "hy_daily_levels"
```

### Ploting rain and flow


``` r
g <- ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_bar(data = rain, aes(x = date, y = (total_rain * 2)), stat = "identity",
           alpha = 0.7, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_line(data = flow, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = bquote(Total~Flow~(m^3/s)), expand = c(0, 0),
                     limits = c(0, max(flow$Value * 1.1)),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(transform = ~ . / 2, name = "Total Rain (mm)"))
```

```
## Error: object 'flow' not found
```

``` r
g
```

```
## Error: object 'g' not found
```


Interesting, looks like there's a bit of a lag between the rain event and the
dramatic increase in water flow in the Assiniboine (unsurprisingly, this is
called "lag to peak").

Let's add a bit of information about this lag to peak.


``` r
d <- data.frame(dates = c(rain$date[which.max(rain$total_precip)],
                          flow$Date[which.max(flow$Value)]),
                y = max(flow$Value) + 5)
```

```
## Error: object 'flow' not found
```

``` r
g +
  geom_path(data = d, aes(x = dates, y = y),
              arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "lines"), ends = "both", type = "closed")) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = d$dates[1] + (d$dates[2] - d$dates[1])/2,
           y = d$y[1] + 10,
           label = glue("{d$dates[2] - d$dates[1]}-day delay"))
```

```
## Error: object 'g' not found
```

We can expect a lag like this because much of the flow being captured by the Brandon HYDAT
station is from precipitation in the upstream catchment area (not only from
local contributions), which takes time to travel.


### Ploting rain and water level


``` r
g <- ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_bar(data = rain,
           aes(x = date, y = (total_rain/65) + min(level$Value)),
           stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_line(data = level, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Water Level (m)", expand = c(0, 0),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(transform = ~ (. - min(level$Value)) * 65,
                                         name = "Total Rain (mm)")) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(min(level$Value), max(level$Value)*1.001))
```

```
## Error: object 'level' not found
```

``` r
g
```

```
## Error: object 'g' not found
```

Again there looks to be a lag, let's see if it's the same as before.


``` r
d <- data.frame(dates = c(rain$date[which.max(rain$total_precip)],
                          level$Date[which.max(level$Value)]),
                y = max(level$Value)*1.00025)
```

```
## Error: object 'level' not found
```

``` r
g +
  geom_path(data = d, aes(x = dates, y = y),
              arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "lines"), ends = "both", type = "closed")) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = d$dates[1] + (d$dates[2] - d$dates[1])/2,
           y = d$y[1] * 1.0002,
           label = glue("{d$dates[2] - d$dates[1]}-day delay"))
```

```
## Error: object 'g' not found
```


### Ploting flow and water level

Looks like the flow and water level match up, perhaps we should take a closer look.


``` r
ggplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position.inside = c(0.8, 0.8)) +
  geom_line(data = flow, aes(x = Date, y = Value, colour = "Flow"),
            linewidth = 2) +
  geom_line(data = level, linewidth = 1,
            aes(x = Date, y = (Value - min(Value) + 0.1) * 130, colour = "Level")) +
  scale_y_continuous(bquote(Total~Flow~(m^3/s)), expand = c(0, 0),
                     sec.axis = sec_axis(transform = ~ ./130 + min(level$Value) - 0.1,
                                         name = "Water Level (m)")) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Type",
                      values = c("Flow" = "cornflowerblue",
                                 "Level" = "grey30"))
```

```
## Error: object 'flow' not found
```

Almost a perfect match between water level and flow (which makes sense).
